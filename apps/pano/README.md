# Development

- Start the Application and Postgres Database in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started):

```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

The database seed script creates a new user with some data you can use to get started:

- Username: `admin`
- Password: `123123`

### Formatting

We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for auto-formatting in this project. It's recommended to install an editor plugin (like the [VSCode Prettier plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)) to get auto-formatting on save.
