# Welcome to kamp-us contributing guide
Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! Any contribution you make will be reflected on kamp-us.

Read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## New contributor guide
To get an overview of the project, read the [README](./README.md). Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)
- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

## Getting started

### Issues
#### Create new issue
If you spot a problem with the project, search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant issue form.

#### Solve an issue
Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using labels as filters. See Labels for more information. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make changes

- Fork the repository.
- Using GitHub Desktop:
  - [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to fork the repo!
- Using the command line:
  - [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.
- Install [Volta](https://volta.sh/) and setup the project. For more information, see the [development guide](./DEVELOPMENT.md).
- Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### Commit your update
Commit the changes once you are happy with them. Don't forget to self-review to speed up the review process.

### Pull request
When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill the PR template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to link PR to issue if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to allow maintainer edits so the branch can be updated for a merge. Once you submit your PR, a kamp-us team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using suggested changes or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this git tutorial to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged!
Congratulations ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ The kamp-us team thanks you.
